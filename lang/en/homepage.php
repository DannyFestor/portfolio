                    Hi, I'm Danny, a German Freelance Web Developer living in
                    Nagasaki, Japan, with my wife and daughter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have many years of experience using PHP with Laravel realizing
                    my client's dream projects and helping my clients connect with their
                    customers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm passionate about creating fast, functional, and
                    user-friendly reactive websites using PHP, Laravel, and Livewire. I have
                    a strong understanding of web development best practices, and
                    I'm always up-to-date on the latest technologies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm also a great communicator, and I'm always happy to work with
                    clients to understand their needs and deliver a website that
                    meets their expectations. In regular meeting calls I offer clients
                    the chance to review my current progress, and adjust the next steps
                    to ensure the project develops exactly as hoped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the services I offer:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Custom Website Development - Realize the Homepage of your dreams</li>

                        <li>Content management systems (CMS) - I build a CMS that fits exactly your needs; no need for insecure plugin monsters</li>
                        <li>SEO - Let's jump to the top of Google results with optimized Meta-Tags and Semantic HTML</li>

                    </ul>
                </p>

                    I'm confident that I can help you create a website that meets
                    your needs and exceeds your expectations.
