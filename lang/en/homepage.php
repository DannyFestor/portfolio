                    I have many years of experience using PHP with Laravel and JavaScript. My favorite stack is Laravel with either Livewire and Alpine.js or Inertia.js and Vue.js.

                    I love learning new technologies and frameworks, and I'm always looking to improve
                    my knowledge in the technologies I use. My goal is to create clean, maintainable, and secure
                    applications.
